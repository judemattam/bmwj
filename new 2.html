<p><font color="white"align="center" size="4" > Introducing the first ever BMW 2 Series Gran Coupé. Seen here as an M235i xDrive model in Snapper Rocks Blue paint finish and also available as an M Sport model, it’s a perfect balance of athleticism and refinement. From the aggressive front, with its iconic shark-nose design, to the impressive rear with LED taillights and dual exhaust pipes, which comes as a single tailpipe on the BMW 218i model, every detail is geared towards maximising the driving experience. </font></p>
